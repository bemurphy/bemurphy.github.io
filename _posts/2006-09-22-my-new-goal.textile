I've decided that my new goal for the year is to gain (or is it regain?) my BJJ blue belt.  Hopefully this will take me less than 12 months.  I was pretty much one before, ten years ago, but quit right before it was official.  Now I plan to make it official.  This is, assuming my joints can take it!
