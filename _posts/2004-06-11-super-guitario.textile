Whoa, a site with guitar and some bass tab for old console games.  Some of the transcriptions are really pathetic, but there's a few good ones.  May I suggest <a href="http://kontek.net/vgjam/nes/smbros_over.txt">Overworld</a> from the original Super Mario Bros game, or something from <a href="http://kontek.net/vgjam/nes/gauntlet_title.txt">Gauntlet</a>.
