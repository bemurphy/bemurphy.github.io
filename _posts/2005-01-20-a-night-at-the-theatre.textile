Last night my girlfriend and I went out to see the play <a href="http://www.scr.org/season/04-05season/mountain.html">_On The Mountain_</a> at the local playhouse.  It was a decent production, though, it was more enjoyable by being there with her.  I will say I quite appreciated the irony that 3 out of the 4 characters actually smoked on stage.  The playbill and program warned of that fact, of course, the program also warned that smoking anywhere on the premisis was strictly prohibited.  And don't they have to get a special permit or something to smoke indoors?  This is still California, right?  Towards the end of the piece, the female lead passionately kissed one of the male characters.  The 80-something year old woman nearby us loudly proclaimed, "She's so aggressive!", much to the amusement of the entire audience.

We also <a href="http://www.techfreak.net/gallery/1-19-2005">got a little cute</a> before the show.
