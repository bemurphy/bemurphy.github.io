I had a busy weekend.  I'm not super inspired to write it all up write now, so I'll just post a short list.

<li>Hung out on Saturday morning at Huntington Beach With <a href="http://gingerstep.blogspot.com">Crista</a>.</li>
<li>Played frisbee.</li>
<li>Watched "Bend it Like Beckham" and "The Aviator" on Saturday afternoon and into the evening.</li>
<li>Helped <a href="http://www.darylsmith.blogspot.com/">Daryl</a> out on the worship team at <a href="http://www.cbchb.com/">CBC</a> in Huntington Beach.</li>
<li>Finally ate at Bagel Me with Crista.  We've been meaning to check it out for a while.</li>
<li>Watched Crista perform in "Anything Goes" at the <a href="http://www.curtaincalltheater.com/">Curtain Call</a>.</li>
