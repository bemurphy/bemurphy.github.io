According to this <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4uk2e">story</a>:

bq. International hip-hop star Xzibit urged artists on Wednesday to try harder to communicate through their music, saying they should stop glorifying violence and get back to being the voice of rebellion and protest.

Umm, is this the same Xzibit that performs the song "Choke Me, Spank Me (Pull My Hair)" on his last album?  Yes, that song is as "good" as you'd guess from the title.  Though who knows, maybe there is some real reform in his future work.
