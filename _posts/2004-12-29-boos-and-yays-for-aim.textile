Today I'm experiencing both the joys and frustrations of using AIM.  I use it all the time, of course, it's nothing new.

On the serious "boo" front, it turns out that whatever the AIM proxy Cingular/ATT is using for the <a href="http://attwireless.com/ogo/index.html">OGOs</a>, well, it kinda blows.  You get disconnected, and it still thinks you're connected.  Takes me multiple times of logging in and out to ever get it to work.  I think my recent attempt took 7 tries.  The error is uninformative, too.

On the "yay" front, I got to chat with <a href="http://rolandrocks.blogspot.com/">Roland</a> for like an hour and some, which was cool.  Ahh, the days of both our jr. high and high school youths spent wanting to look like members of <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:4unyxdabjola">Skid Row</a>.
