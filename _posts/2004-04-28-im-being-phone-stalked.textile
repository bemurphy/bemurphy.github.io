Some ultranationalist white supramicist that the ADL has record of keeps calling me at work.  He's probably called different people 15 times in the past 2 days.  Through screening  calls, I have managed not to talk to him yet.  To top it off, the guy claims to be an attorney.  Still more reason not to talk to him.  Oh the joys...sometimes I love my job.
