Running late to make it to the Huntington Beach <a href="http://www.nppl.tv/hb04tourney.htm">NPPL season opener</a>.  Fortunately (I think) I'm not playing!

Easily, the match of the day will be <a href="http://www.avalanchepaintball.com/2k4/top.swf">Avalanche</a> vs. <a href="http://dynasty.pbnation.com/home.htm">Dynasty</a>.  Not only do these guys know each other and their respective games well, but they are two of the best teams out there.  I'm giddy.
