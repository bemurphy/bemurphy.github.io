I signed a 12 month lease on an apartment this week.  At the end of the month, I'll be starting my move from our rented 2000 square foot house into my 741 square foot one bedroom apartment.  I've been preparing for the past few months by ditching all the stuff that is useless to me, dropping most of it off at Goodwill and the library.  I'm getting much closer to my goal of owning a modest amount of belongings, rather than many which I rarely use.  More soon about why I'm choosing to move.
