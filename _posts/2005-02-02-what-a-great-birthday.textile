OK, so now that I've grumbled about turning 30, let me share about some of the great stuff.

First, Crista helped throw together a surprise party for dinner.  She picked me up around 9:30 and drove me out to the TGIF by her house.  I had no idea until we were practically at the table loaded up with my friends.  It was amazing, I almost cried.  This is no exaggeration.  OK I think I did let a tear escape, so perhaps I should rethink the "almost".  Even my old friend Shane was there.  Crista had never even met him previously, so I was especially surprised.

I also am the new owner of an <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/itrip/index.php" title="iTrip">iTrip</a> for my iPod.  Now what could I possibly want with one since I already have an inline fm modulator in my car, you ask?  OK, you didn't really ask that, but humor me.  Well, I've had this itch for a long time that I want a shower radio.  But I don't really want to listen to the radio.  I can't exactly bring my iPod in the shower either.  So, now I can get a shower radio, and leave the iPod nearby transmitting on FM.  I'm so excited, now I just need to find a radio.  I think just about any Target/Circuit City/whatever store has them for about $10, so no sweat.  I just wish I had one for tomorrow morning!

So the short of it: 30 wasn't all bad.
