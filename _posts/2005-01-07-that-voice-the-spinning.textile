Last night I had a bit of a new, good experience.  My girlfriend is performing in a 3 month run of <a href="http://www.theatrehistory.com/american/musical007.html">Brigadoon</a> at the <a href="http://www.curtaincalltheater.com/">local dinner theater</a>, and I went to see opening night.  It was funny that in preparing to go, I felt extrememly nervous.  It was like I was giving a speech in front of a class, and had all the associated butterflies.  But as soon as she came out on stage the first time, those all went away.  It's a pretty interesting experience to see your girlfriend in about 3 layers of skirts and wearing hair extensions (I think it's actually called a fall).

A surprising element to me is that I even enjoyed the show more than I anticipated.  We'd watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046807/">the movie</a> together, and both agreed it was pretty weak.  But I must admit, I remember smiling and laughing through the evening moreso than any night in recent memory.  I'm also glad I finally got to visit the place, it's something I've driven past for as long as I can remember (maybe 20 years?) but never been into.

And best of all, I got to see my girlfriend sing in front of a few hundred people.   Unbelievably cool.
