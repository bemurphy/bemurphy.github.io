McDonald's is launching <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=638&e=1&u=/nm/20040415/en_nm/leisure_mcdonalds_dc">anti-obesity campaign</a>[yahoo news].  What are they gonna call it, "Don't Eat Here"?

On the list of signs you are really lazy should be added "You go to McDonalds to buy a salad with bottled water".
