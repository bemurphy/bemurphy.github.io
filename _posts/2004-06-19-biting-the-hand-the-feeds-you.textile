I was reading the <a href="http://www.downhillbattle.org/">downhillbattle.org</a> site the other day, and came across a succinct <a href="http://www.downhillbattle.org/riaa/">viewpoint</a> to the current RIAA tactics of suing families for copyright infringement:

bq. "Whatever you think about filesharing, it's just not okay for giant corporations to sue people with kids, living paycheck to paycheck, who can't afford a defense."

Now on to dealing with the slightly older consumers.  In case you've never read the <a href="http://www.authorama.com/free-culture-6.html">story</a> of the RIAA trying to get $15,000,000 from New York college freshman Jesse Jordan, it's a good read.  He ended up paying an initial settlement of $12k.  As the tale is recounted, he wasn't even sharing the files, he'd written a search engine to index them.
