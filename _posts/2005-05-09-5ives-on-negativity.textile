What are five things I currently do not like?

<ol>
<li>Mac vs. Windows vs. Linux flame wars.</li>
<li>Obfuscating dogmatism as certainty in "facts".</li>
<li>Advertising by any soft drink manufacturer which implies sugar water can somehow improve your life.</li>
<li>Convergent thinking in absence of divergent thinking.</li>
<li>Overuse of loaded labels, such as liberal or conservative.</li>
</ol>
