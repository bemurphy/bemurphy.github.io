The Finnish government just shut down a service sending text message replies <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=573&ncid=757&e=2&u=/nm/20040116/od_nm/odd_finland_jesus_dc">allegedly from Jesus</a> in answer to peoples prayer requests.  My favorite quote from the article:

__He declined to say how many prayers had been received, but added: "This was no gold mine... It seems you can't interest people in everything." __

You don't say!  You mean, people didn't buy into the notion that Jesus has a cell phone?
