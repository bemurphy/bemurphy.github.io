I'm totally exhausted this week, especially today.  I can't figure it out, I haven't stayed out too late recently.  I might have a sinus infection, I know I felt pretty stuffed the past couple mornings, but I'm clear about 3 hours after getting up.  I just want to go home, take my contacts out, and read or sleep now.

Update: oh duh, I just remembered I keep waking up with weird dreams in the morning.  I was awake from like 4-7 this morning.
