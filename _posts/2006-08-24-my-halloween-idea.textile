OK, so I want to host a get together for this Halloween.  Here is my idea in a nutshell.  First, we will be pirates.  Secondly, there will be a pirate themed game.  And lastly, there will be grog.  Or, something like it, with, um, tiny umbrellas.  Perhaps the tiny umbrellas will have skull & crossbones to make them more groggy.  Yeah.

Who's interested?
