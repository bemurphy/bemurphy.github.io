I picked up the album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00008XS4D/qid=1109031238/sr=8-2/ref=pd_csp_2/104-2027471-4267114?v=glance&s=music&n=507846">Castaways & Cutouts</a> by The Decemberists off <a href="http://www.emusic.com" title="emusic">EMusic</a>.  It's pretty darn good.  So far I like tracks 1 and 3 the best.

I took the EMusic 50 downloads trial and have scored some other good music so far.  I finally picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000CABFR/104-2027471-4267114">The Fire Theft</a> from them, which I've been meaning to get for a while.  Can't beat free (and legal), can you?
