There are some shows I watch that I love.  'Lost' is of course one of them.  I love the show _and_ it's a great show.  For new episodes, I often have Justin, Chris, Ashley, and sometimes Crista over to watch.

I also watch '24' pretty religiously.  It's an entertaining, but by no means great show.  Maybe not even a good show.  But I consider it my guilty pleasure show.  So, if you'd like to come over and watch it with me, please do.  It's on Monday's at 9pm on fox.  Comment if you'd like to pop-in tonight, Crista and I will be watching.  I'll be there by 8pm if you want to come early to hang out.
