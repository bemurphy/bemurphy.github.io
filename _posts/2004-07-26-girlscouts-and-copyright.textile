The Girl Scouts have a <a href="http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/music/">page</a> with brief points as to using songs at organization events.  Know why?  Because they nearly got a <a href="http://www.authorama.com/free-culture-3.html">beatdown</a> from <a href="http://www.ascap.org">ASCAP</a> over campfire songs.

As a punitive measure, may I suggest the Scouts selectively withhold their sought after cookies from those behind the original threats.
