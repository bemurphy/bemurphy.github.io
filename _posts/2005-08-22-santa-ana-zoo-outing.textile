Crista and I visited the <a href="http://santaanazoo.org/">Santa Ana Zoo</a> on Sunday.  I <a href="http://www.techfreak.net/wp/wp-gallery2.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&g2_itemId=2287">posted</a> a few pictures up to the gallery.  We were quite silly in a few.  I think my favorite monkeys were the <a href="http://www.techfreak.net/wp/wp-gallery2.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&g2_itemId=2357">pygmy marmosets</a>.  The picture is blurry so it's hard to tell, but they are quite small.  They are the smallest kind of monkeys in the world, the adults only grow to weigh six ounces.  They can move quite quick, but usually they creep along really slow like they are a lizard.  It's rather funny to watch.

On a related note, I think it's time I look for a 5+ megapixel camera.
