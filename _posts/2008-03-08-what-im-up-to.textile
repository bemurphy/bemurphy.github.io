Been very busy with work lately.  Here's some things I'm up to.

<ul>
<li>Reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Ruby-Russ-Olsen/dp/0321490452" title="Design Patterns in Ruby">Design Patterns in Ruby</a> by <a href="http://www.jroller.com/rolsen/">Russ Olsen</a></li>
<li>Settling into the Systems Engineering groups at work.  I transferred from IT to Engineering a few months back, it's shaping up well for me at this point.</li>
<li>Playing with the new MacBook Pro</li>
<li>Messing around on <a href="http://twitter.com//xternal">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://pownce.com/xternal/">Pownce</a></li>
<li>Posting some moronic photos to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/xternal1/">Flickr</a></li>
<li>Adding <a href="http://site.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a> support to my comments.</li>
<li>Trying to resist buying one of <a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/global/">these</a>.  Thanks a lot, <a href="http://www.brendoman.com/">Brendan</a>.</li>
<li>Toying with the <a href="http://pownce.pbwiki.com/API%20Documentation2-0">Pownce API</a></li>
<li>And much , much more!  Heh.</li>
</ul>
