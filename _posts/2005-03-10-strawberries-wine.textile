I just wanted to take a minute to brag about the fantastic dinner that was prepared for me last night.  Crista had me over to hang out at her apartment, and she even provided dinner.  All I had to do was bring the wine.  As I'm no sort of connoisseur, I resorted to a bottle of two buck chuck chardonnay.  It proved more suitable to our unexperienced tastes than the merlot that we had last time.  We also ate some fabulous soy ginger marinated salmon, rice, salad, and asparagus.  For those of you that don't like asparagus, well, I think you're missing out.

Then, we capped off with dessert.  I think if all we'd eaten was dessert, I would have still been a happy man.  We started with some semisweet chocolate dipped bananas.  Those were pretty good.  But then, oh man, it was on to dipped strawberries.  I don't know if there is a more simple pleasure than this.  It was the most delicious thing I've eaten all week.  No hyperbole at all.

So, should you ever be bored and have a hard time eating enough fruit, just keep this in mind.  It balances out, right?
