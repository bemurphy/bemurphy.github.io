I'm finally starting back up with reading Lessig's "Free Culture".  From chapter 10, I bring you the following tidbits.

<ul>
	<li>Default copyright durations have tripled in the past 30 years.</li>
	<li>John McCain's summary of FCC information on media ownership: "five companies control 85 percent of our media sources."</li>
	<li>Before deregulation of radio, the largest broadcast company owned fewer than 75 stations.  Now there is one company which owns 1,200+ stations.</li> 
	<li>Four companies control 90 percent of radio advertising revenues.</li>
</ul>

You wonder why you hear that same damn song everywhere you go?
