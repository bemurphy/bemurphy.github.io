I woke up fully planning to play paintball today.  It just isn't going to pan out.  There's something to be said for the motivation it takes to drag yourself out of bed and then go get shot at.  Especially on a Sunday, as you tend to get shot at more.

It doesn't help that yesterday I almost lost my temper a few times.  What started as a good morning turned into a not so great afternoon.  Always the proper makings for a contemplative drive home (in traffic, no less).

So today, I've convinced myself to do something productive.  Maybe clean my room and car.  Ah yes, more motivation needed...
