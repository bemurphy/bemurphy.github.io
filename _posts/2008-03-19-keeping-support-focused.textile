I was just browsing the <a href="http://automattic.com">automattic.com</a> <a href="http://automattic.com/about/how-we-work/">How We Work page</a> and ran across this tidbit:
bq. Everyone who joins, regardless of position, does support for their first three weeks.
Now, I'd probably kinda-hate doing that, but it seems like a possibly great idea for keeping good customer service at the heart of a company.  I think it would also be tough for bigger, more traditional companies to pull off, but it's an interesting concept still.
