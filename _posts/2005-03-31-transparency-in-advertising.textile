I just saw a hilarious ad on cable for a local Infiniti car dealship.  The ad features former basketball player and commentator Bill Walton.  Yeah, off to a good start.  So, Bill comes waltzing from behind one of the cars parked inside the dealership and forcefully proclaims, "Everything you'll ever need in life is right here".

Everything?  I mean, come on, who writes this garbage.  I can get food, water, shelter, friendship, and companionship at the dealership?  I think not.

It's funny to me to see an advertisement which bluntly proclaims the message that lies in all advertising:  "All you need is brand X, and you won't be happy without it".  It's just funny to see it presented with practically no veil.
