* Version control

* Github

* Twitter

* Fall in like with your editor

* Don't be dogmatic

* Always be explaining - 2 contexts, I don't get it and I think I get it. Rubber ducking

* Pace Yourself

* Read books/code/blogs

* Don't hate on yourself in comments

* You can't keep up, it's ok - digestable chunks
- if you feel this way, pick one chunk, do it

* Pick idols, then connect with them

* Fake it till you make it

* User groups

* Be well rounded

* No analysis paralysis

* Drive by tests/docs

* You can't be perfect.  Breathe

* Set goals
