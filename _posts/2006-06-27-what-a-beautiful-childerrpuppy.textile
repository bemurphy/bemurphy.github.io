People in Irvine base their life too much off, I don't know, maybe television.  This morning on the drive to work, I saw a woman walking her puppy in our area.  She was also dragging a red radio flyer wagon behind her.  Now, normally a radio flyer wagon is used to drag kids, toys, stuff like that.  Right?

She had another puppy resting in the wagon.  I can only hope the puppy recently had surgery because, if not, um, ya....
