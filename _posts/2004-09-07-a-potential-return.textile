That's right kiddos, a paintball post.  After a 3 month or so hiatus, I'm considering playing again this Saturday.  I'll want something active to go do during the day to keep myself occupied.   I have so many questions though, such as:

<ul>
<li>Exactly how rusty and out-of-shape will I be?</li>
<li>How long will it take to re-adapt to the pain factor?</li>
<li>Will my guns even work without a ton of tlc, having not cycled for so long?</li>
<li>Will I be able to endure the 100 degree heat?</li>
<li>Is the addiction really vanquished, and can I do it and have a great time without shutting out my non-pb friends?</li>
<li>How many games till I seriously injure myself on the dirt?</li>
<li>Will any of my old friends be there? (probably not)</li>
</ul>

Stay tuned...
<div class="update">Update:  Too hot for my tastes this weekend.  Don't want to consider playing for the first time in months in 96 degree heat.</div>
