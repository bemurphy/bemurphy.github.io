So Friday, I'm flying for the first time.  The first time since 1993.

Why have I not flown in so long?  Simple, I let it terrify me.

I can't live with such limitations for life.  How many fun opportunities have I passed up before because of this fear?  I've lost count.  But now, one of Crista's best friends is getting married in Oklahoma City this Saturday.  I certainly don't want to ditch out on that.

So I had my first travelocity experience.  Car, planes, hotel, all supposedly lined up.  I don't worry about any of that.  Just about being in the air.  I think I can handle it this time.  I'm older, and in far better control of my emotions.

Plus, I bought a PSP to distract myself.

Fingers crossed.
