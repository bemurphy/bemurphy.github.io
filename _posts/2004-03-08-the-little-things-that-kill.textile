They sent out a floorwide email today notifying us the mens restroom on our floor would be closed for work.  No biggie.

However, the scary <a href="http://www.techfreak.net/mt/mblog/archives/000067.html">warning sign</a> reading "Microbial Hazard" in huge letters on the door kinda makes one wonder.

UPDATE:  Rumor has it, they were trying to kill some mold outbreak, and mixed the wrong chemicals.  Somebody passed out in there!
