My cynical prediction is that when Everwood returns, Ephram will be dressed like he's singing for The Killers or some equivalent.  Then we can come up with cute names like Emowood.

I like The Killers, but boy, has the fashion these days gotten ridiculous.  Orange County is swimming in the mod look, and the colors pink and black.  At the Getty Center on Saturday, I think I saw somebodies gramma wearing pink and black.  Can you say, "Gone too far?"
