One of those "why do I do this" mornings.  Looking at the weather forecast, slight chance of showers.  I almost wish it would rain, then I'd have a good excuse not to go to SC to practice.  Am I feeling older?  Or do I just need to move more during the week.  Waking up on a Saturday with stiff hips is not acceptable.  Perhaps I should actually *start* running again as I had planned.

Yet, I'm getting ready and still up for the drive.
