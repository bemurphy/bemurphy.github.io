I turned 30 today.  Yay me.

In case you can't tell, I am not too thrilled.  Somehow, I see 30 as really old.  No offense to those over 30 of course.  I decided that in honor of my birthday (and weakening body) I would take a floating holiday today.  We get two a year, and I figured, what better time.  Of course, I did nothing of great value, other than lounge around the house and play on the internet.  At least I spent some time organizing my photos.

I'm excited about tonight.  In three hours, Crista is taking me to a surprise location to eat.  I'm not even going to try and guess, that would spoil the fun.

Thanks to those of you who sent me greeting cards, emails, and gifts today.  They were greatly appreciated.
