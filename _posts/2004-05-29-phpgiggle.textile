Thanks to NuclearMoose on #wordpress, I came across the phpGiggle plugin.  It's quite useful, essentially it preprocesses text and will translate keywords you've establed into automatic links.  So instead of slamming in the link to a friends site evertime, you just type it.  The word biolachris is automatically parsed, for example.
