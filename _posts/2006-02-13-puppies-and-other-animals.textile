So I got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00078ZGTA">Nintendo DS</a> last week.  That explains the <a href="http://www.techfreak.net/wp/index.php/archives/2006/02/10/298/">virtual puppy</a>.  The virtual puppy is from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0009YDS10">Nintendogs</a> game.   I also picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0009YDS10">Animal Crossing: Wild World</a> at <a href="http://www.brendoman.com/">Brendan's</a> urging.  Thankfully he hooked me up with some great items during online play the other night.  It's great fun.

Beware, both games are like virtual crack.  If you value your time, loved ones, and tendons, don't get them.

But they are real fun.  Nintendogs also seems to be the first game ever to entertain my mother.
