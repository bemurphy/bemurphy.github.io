As in, "Yet another Double Standard".

Call me lonely and bitter if you like, you're probably right.  But somewhat recently I've made an observation in scanning various social networking sites.  I refer to them as SNS, because saying I'm scanning singles sites makes me feel like a loser.  Go figure.

But here's the deal.  Typically, women are asking guys be significantly taller than them (it would seem at least 3 inches) and quite often 5'10" or taller.  This is, it would seem, socially acceptable given the frequency it occurs.  I will admit, too, I'd feel some discomfort dating a woman remarkably taller than me. 

Let's flip this around though.  Say that the guys on such sites started a trend of posting that into their "About my match" type sections, things like "must be a C cup".  Now, it's true many of these guys are thinking this, but NOBODY is saying it.  And if they were saying it, all hell would break lose on the the systems.  I guarantee it.  

I'm not saying *I* plan to start thinking this way or think it justified.  Just seems to me a common behavior that manages to stay under the radar.  Now don't I just sound pretentious?

Oh, and there's a SocialSoftwareBlog that supports some of my non-scientific analysis.
