Uhh, anybody notice the explosion of pleated skirts the girls are wearing?  Or maybe it's just me, considering I live in OC, the Emo/Stars/Xxxmyheart[cries|bleeds|tears|aches|longs|dies]for youxXX capital of the world.

Do people really think these things look good?  I'm hardly sold.

Here is my secret (oops, not anymore) plan to banishing the pleated skirt.  It's rooted in truth, everytime you see one now, you will think this.  Just tell people "that skirt makes you look fat".
