I've been feeling massive urges recently to buy a ton of gadgets.  I really love gadgets.  If I went nuts, here's a list of things I'd look at to buy:

<ul>
<li>A new digital camera</li>
<li>A new mp3 player (perhaps an ipod or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002UB2P0/qid=1095370636/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/002-5563077-9428842?v=glance&s=electronics&n=507846">Rio Carbon</a>)</li>
<li>A cell phone like the <a href="http://www.infosyncworld.com/reviews/n/4875.html">nokia 6820</a></li>
<li>A sidekick II (they're <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/5843952295216041/">sold out</a>!)</li>
<li>A Gameboy Advanced SP</li>
</ul>

It would of course, I think, be bad to buy more than 3 of these at the same time.
