I managed to pack 3 meat substitute products into meals today.  Even for me, that's a lot.  Hopefully not an unhealthly "a lot".  At lunch, it was soy imitation ground beef, with dinner, ground <a href="http://www.quorn.com/us/index.htm">quorn</a>, and tofu in miso soup as a late night snack.

You'd be surprised how much ground up vat grown mushrooms can taste like meat.  No, really.
