I'm excited because I just discovered that one of my favorite bands, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calexico">Calexico</a>, released a live session EP on iTunes recently.  Their music is awesome, I'd describe it as an eclectic blend of rock and spaghetti western music, with surf and southwest sounds slapped on top.  Much of their <a href="http://www.emusic.com/artist/11600/11600082.html">collection</a> is available on emusic. I recommend checking them out.
