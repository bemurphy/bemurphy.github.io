There's a browser extension I just ran across called <a href="http://www.corestreet.com/spoofstick/">SpoofStick</a> that sounds pretty interesting.  It basically sticks a message up in your browser for any site you go to that says what domain you are currently on.  The goal, obviously, is to prevent falling victim to <a href="http://www.antiphishing.org/">phishing attacks</a>.

Only downside, according to <a href="http://www.incidents.org/diary.php?date=2004-08-17&isc=145f141710fae09ede757d76aabc111b">incidents.org</a> the utility doesn't appropriate handle a more recent <a href="http://secunia.com/advisories/12304/">spoofing vulnerability</a> in IE.
