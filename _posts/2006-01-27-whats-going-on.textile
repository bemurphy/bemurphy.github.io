I figured I'd just bullet point random happenings for the past couple weeks.

<ul>
<li>I successfully flew to and from Oklahoma City and experience nothing remotely like a panic attack.  A few nerves, sure, but nothing bad.</li>
<li>I've gone to <a href="http://www.stmatthewsacc.com/">St. Matthew's Anglican Catholic Church</a> a couple more times.  They have an inquirer's group running now.  I'm not attending but going through the material from the classes.</li>
<li>Crista and I started playing a game of <a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/bti.shtml">Breaking the Ice</a>.  We're 1/3 done.  Fun, hard, fresh, and creative so far.  I'll probably do a write-up if I can remember everything.</li>
<li>I'm still looking into starting a <a href="http://www.techfreak.net/wp/index.php/archives/2005/12/13/290/">game club</a>.</li>
<li>I'm going to have to seriously tweak my blog frontpage, as the MySQL slowness is killing it.</li>
<li>I got geekdome + 1 by running my very first game ever.  It was a session of <a href="http://www.peginc.com/Games/Savage%20Worlds/Savage%20Worlds.htm">Savage Worlds</a> played online, and it was lots of fun.</li>
</ul>
