If I was stuck in a basement for a very long time and hadn't realized the depth to which LA news had sunk, today I would know for sure.  So what happened in the news today?  Let's see, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/02/01/hajj.stampede/index.html">240+ people trampled to death</a> in Saudi Arabia...<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/02/01/sprj.nirq.main/index.html">56 killed</a> in dual suicide bombings in Iraq...

So what does CBS 2 run as the "Top Story" at 9?  The SuperBowl mishap with Janet Jackson's wardrobe.  Mmmm...yes...top story.

In other news of media suckage, CBS aired their usual fair of beer and "chick" ads, but bailed on the <a href="http://www.moveon.org/cbs/ad/">MoveOn.org spot</a>.
