I've successfully connected to Google's new instant messaging service, powered by <a href="http://www.jabber.org">jabber</a>.  Rumor has it they are unveiling the service tomorrow.  Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, server to server jabber communications are not yet enabled.  If s2s gets turned on, jabber will get the shot in the arm it needs.

If you have a gmail account and jabber client, check out this <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/it/05/08/23/2316223.shtml?tid=217&tid=218">slashdot story</a>.
