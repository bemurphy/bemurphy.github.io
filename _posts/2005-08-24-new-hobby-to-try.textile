Last night I stopped by <a href="http://www.michaels.com/art/online/home">Michael's Arts and Crafts Store</a> in Tustin with Crista to peruse what they had.  I walked out with an essential oil diffuser, which is something I've wanted to pickup for a long time.  It's soapstone and matches my <a href="http://www.pier1.com/store/productdetail.asp?catalog%5Fname=Pier1&strStoreNavDept=&strStoreNavClass=&search=true&multipleresults=true&strSearchDescr=incense&intSearchPriceRangeID=0&intSearchCategoryID=0&intSearchTypeID=2&category_name=GROUP+50949+Soapstone+Incense+Burner&intPageNumber=1&intSetNumber=1">incense burner</a> I got from Pier 1.

Crista picked up some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crochet">crochet</a> hooks and yarn to make me a blanket.  It was fascinating to watch her work.  I was reminded of my elementary school years when my friends and I got absorbed in finger knitting.  I'm going to want to give it a go sometime.

I walked out of the store with a <a href="http://www.joann.com/catalog.jhtml?CATID=124231&PRODID=128219&source=search">needlepoint kit</a>.  Yes, I am still a guy.  If you have a problem with it, take it up with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/69799427@N00/sets/491625/">Rosey Grier</a>.
