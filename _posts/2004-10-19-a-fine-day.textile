Normally, I don't break up my workday much.  Like many in the networking industry, I'm one of those eat at the keyboard kinda guys.

So today around lunchtime, my <a href="http://www.techfreak.net/gallery/Danapoint/09230016_G">girlfriend</a> decided she could come hang out with me for 20 minutes or so.  It was such a great break in the middle of the day.  The neat part is, my hand still smells like her perfume, so it is like she's not totally gone.  It started raining too.  Don't laugh, rain in California is an event.  There's just something nice about spending time with someone in the weather as the seasons change.

More mushy than usual, but I don't care.
