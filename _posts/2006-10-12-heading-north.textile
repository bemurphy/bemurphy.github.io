Just about to pull out of here to head for Pleasanton with William.  I'm looking forward to seeing my grandmother for a brief time tomorrow, but worried about the lack of sleep we face this weekend.  It will be nice to get out somewhere new though.  If all goes according to plan I should be back Monday night!
