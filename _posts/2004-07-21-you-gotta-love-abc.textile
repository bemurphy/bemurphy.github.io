Remember from a week or so ago, when ABC Primetime President Stephen McPherson <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/wire/Entertainment/reuters20040712_424.html">accused</a> Fox networks of taking on the role of programming imitator, saying "They will steal it, plain and simple"?

I just saw an ad for the upcoming ABC reality series titled "The Benefactor".  Immediately, I thought it seemed an awful lot like the NBC show "The Apprentice".  Checking the ABC official <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/schedule/2004-05/thebenefactor.html">write up</a> of the show, you can find the following :
bq. What would you do for a million dollars? Billionaire businessman and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is about to find out because he is "The Benefactor," and he's set to give away a million bucks to a complete stranger.
Nice.  Billionaire businessman.  Nope, it's not an apprentice clone.   Entertainment critics from sources like <a href="http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:mwhfwAAIjhYJ:www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36%25257E122%25257E2158880,00.html+the+benefactor+%2B+apprentice+clone&hl=en">The Denver Post</a> and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-05-18-abc-fall-lineup_x.htm">USA Today</a> have not dubbed the show an apprentice clone.

These network folk truly must not see how thinly veiled their hypocrisy is.
