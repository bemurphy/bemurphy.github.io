My girlfriend <a href="http://gingerstep.blogspot.com">Crista</a> is working a show at <a href="http://www.knotts.com/">Knott's Berry Farm</a> right now.  They pulled her during a break yesterday to <a href="http://gingerstep.blogspot.com/2005/08/listy-list.html">do some voiceovers</a> for Knott's Scary Farm.  I'm excited, I'm _so there_ to listen to her work of random screams, an evil valley girl princess, and my favorite: the drunken british diva.  Accents, fake or not, are hot.
