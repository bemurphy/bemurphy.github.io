Thanks to all who showed up last night.  I had a lot of fun and am glad you could show up.

As for next week, we still have the <a href="http://www.techfreak.net/wp/index.php/archives/2006/02/27/303/">same movie in store</a> as I'd planned for this week.  I forgot the Oscars were on and it sucked us in instead.  Also, I will startup the video games again next week, but as the host I will be participating in some kind of board or other table top game.  Got to keep the playtime balanced!

See you next Sunday.
