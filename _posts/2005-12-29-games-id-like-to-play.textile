Here's a list of the games I'd really like to play with some friends.  They are mostly what I'd call Storytelling games.  I take that definition as kind of a cross between role playing games and storytelling.  Another description might be collaborative storytelling.  If you played in our recent group <a href="http://www.atlas-games.com/onceuponatime/index.php">Once Upon a Time</a> game, you have a flavor for such a game, albeit lighter weight than the following.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.tao-games.com/games_polaris.shtml">Polaris</a>: already own it</li>
<li><a href="http://www.septemberquestion.org/lumpley/dogsources.html">Dogs in the Vineyard</a>: willing to buy it</li>
<li><a href="http://www.halfmeme.com/master.html">My Life with Master</a>: bought it</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ramshead.indie-rpgs.com/WhatIsUniversalis.html">Universalis</a>: in the mail</li>
</ul>

I also want to run a game of <a href="http://www.atlas-games.com/pandemonium/index.php">Pandemonium</a>, which is more of a straight laced RPG, minus the magic and dwarves.  Other more traditional RPGs I'm interested in are <a href="http://www.chaosium.com/index.php?section_id=13">Call of Cthulhu</a> (ooo...scary) and <a href="http://www.atlas-games.com/crown/index.php">Northern Crown</a>.
