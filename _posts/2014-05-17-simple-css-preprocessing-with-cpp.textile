Sometimes when prototyping a quick, small app, I find myself wanting a subset of Sass's features without everything.  Specially, I love having variables available, and the option to split into multiple files for organization.

Then I read "this post":http://blog.arkency.com/2013/09/throw-away-sprockets-use-unix/ and wondered how I could use cpp towards such a goal.  The answer is pretty simple.  An example app.css file:

{% highlight css %}
#define $text_color #333
#define $border_color #eee

#import "comments.css"
#import "posts.css"
{% endhighlight %}

And in posts.css:

{% highlight css %}
.posts .post {
  border: 1px solid $border_color;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Running _(code)cpp -P app.css_ outputs the following:

{% highlight css %}
.posts .post {
  border: 1px solid #eee;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is no "replacement" for sprockets or sass, but a nice trick to have up your sleeve!
