My practical side says choose the cheapest path of least resistance.  Recently, I decided what that would be for me.  That is, any RIAA distributed CDs I will only buy used, any non-RIAA I will buy new.  Now, if I could get an extra $1 into the artists hands in the process, I'd have the record company payouts to artists beat.

The path of p2p music and movie sharing still has too much legal resistance for my taste.  Sure, only a handful of the total involved are getting sued, but I'm wary.

It doesn't help that I get DMCA notices at work for our customers.  That rattles you a bit.
