Well, it's a half road trip, as it's for business.  I volunteered to go up next weekend with my co-worker William to Pleasanton, CA (it's near SF) to help move our server room up there.  It's about an hour away from my grandmother's place, which I haven't had a chance to visit yet.  So we'll leave Thursday, check into the hotel that night, and I'll probably visit family on Friday.  Then we start the big move at about 11pm.  I hope it doesn't kill us dead tired!  But, it should be fun, and I'll get to meet people from the company I haven't bumped into yet.
