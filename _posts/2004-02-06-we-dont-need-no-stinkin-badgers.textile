Apparently somewhere near my house they're doing construction this morning.  I can't tell what.  I keep hearing the "beep beep beep" of trucks backing up.  Plus, there's the occassional shreak of a power tool.  Waking up to the sound of said tool, my initial reaction was "is somebody torturing a badger?"

Now, a real tortured badger would probably sound much more shrill.  But hey, that's what I thought.

So here I find myself awake and typing far earlier than I should be.  I know, the world says "Boo hoo, you woke up before 7".  No, seriously, it's traumatic for me.   It always makes me feel sick to my stomach, literally.  Every time I have to wake up earlier to make a tournament, I feel this way.  Not from anxiety.  It's odd, I wonder what the reasoning behind it is.  And go figure, the earlier I wake up, the hungrier I am.

Perhaps google can satisfy my curiosity.
