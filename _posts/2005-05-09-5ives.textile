In conjunction with my <a href="http://www.techfreak.net/wp/index.php?m=200505#post-245">recent post</a>, I've got some lists to create.  I'm going to use this as an excuse to create a new category I've wanted to for a while, called 5ives.  The idea is taken from Merlin Mann's <a href="http://www.5ives.com">5ives.com</a> site.  The idea is simple, ask a question, give 5 answers.

So, here is the first question.  What are five things I know I like to do right now.  I'm going to be vague in answering right now, I figure I can then use the answers for more questions later.

<ol>
<li>Reading books, especially on cognitive-behavorial therapy.</li>
<li>Working on computers.</li>
<li>Spending time with my girlfriend Crista.</li>
<li>Engaging in divergent thinking.</li>
<li>Improving my ability to relax to break obsessional thinking patterns and decrease my anxiety level.</li>
</ol>
