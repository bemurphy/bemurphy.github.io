Of course, mother nature can be a different story.  As I left my house Sunday after a powerful storm rocked the area the previous night, I noticed a banged up house, and a few smashed up cars.  Turned out the wind had knocked over a eucalyptus tree, rendering the house uninhabitable.  Talk about bad luck too, there were 20 UCI students <a href="http://www.nbc4.tv/news/3937555/detail.html">sleeping inside</a>.  5 cars were damaged as well.

I'm thankful the trees are far enough from our place.  I don't want to move.
