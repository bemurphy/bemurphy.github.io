So earlier I'd <a href="http://www.techfreak.net/wp/archives/2006/09/22/317/">mentioned</a> that my goal was to get my BJJ blue belt in the next year.  Well, that goal has unceremoniously come and gone.  I haven't had a belt since I've gone back to class, as I couldn't find my old ones.  Well yesterday morning, my teacher flung a blue belt my way: "Murphy, you need your belt".  I was like, uh, I was a blue belt ten years ago, but don't feel like one now.  Well, once one always one I guess.  Now I'm the blue belt who gets beat on by the white belts.  There's only shame in it if I let it bug me, though.

So now my new goal is to actually roll like a blue belt!
