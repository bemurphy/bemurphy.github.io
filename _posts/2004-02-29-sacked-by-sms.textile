South Korea's third largest credit agency laid of 25% of it work force Friday <a href="http://www.forbes.com/work/newswire/2004/02/26/rtr1278406.html">via SMS</a>.  Talk about inappropriate procedure!

<a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/003072.htm">Textually.org</a> has references to previous SMS sackings as well.  So I guess people really do hate conflict.
