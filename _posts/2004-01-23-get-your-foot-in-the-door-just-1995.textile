So the nut jobs over at <a href="http://www.heavenforsure.com/">http://www.heavenforsure.com/</a> are selling "Heaven Insurance" for $19.95.  According to the scam, you get a certificate that gets you in to heaven.  What I really want to know is, how many fools have sent these fools money.  I know it's a small number, but still a sad number I'm sure.  Better act now, or your order may be "cancelled due to limited supply".

Please don't think twice about giving these guys any money, not even as joke.  They're outright scammer and spammers.  I probably shouldn't even be giving their site the time of day.
