Last night C and I <a href="http://www.techfreak.net/gallery/12-1-2004">hung out</a> and had dinner at the <a href="http://www.thaicuisine.com/r/2727.html">Bamboo Thai Bistro</a> in the new Quail Hill shopping center off Sand Canyon.  I hadn't been to the center before, it's pretty sweet.  There's really cool outdoor seating with padded patio furniture, wooden tables (not Irvine/Tustin green metal!) and overhead heaters.  Nice quiet hangout.  It wasn't busy at all because it's atypically cold for California this time of year.

Oh, and the food was great too.  Though, we did wonder why every new restaurant has one or more TVs installed, especially when it doesn't go too well with the atmosphere.
