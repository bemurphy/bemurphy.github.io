My brother's new gallery opening is in a week or so.  I believe it's his third solo showing.  This after being out of college like 2-3 years only.  His work is amazing, much of it larger than life.  Check out <a href="http://www.artnet.com/Galleries/Artists_detail.asp?G=&gid=173223&which=&aid=12292&ViewArtistBy=online&rta=http://www.artnet.com">three examples</a>.  The two on the left are new, the one on the right is from the previous show.  I keep begging him for work, but that's kind of demeaning I think.

His show opens November 5 at <a href="http://www.artnet.com/hs.html">Hunsaker/Schlesinger Fine Art</a> in Santa Monica.
