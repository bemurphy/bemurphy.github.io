My coworker and I just ran across the street to stretch our legs and grab some juice.  I decided on a whim to try a wheatgrass shot from Robek's Juice.  It's something I've always wanted to experience.  Turns out it actually smells more like grass than it tastes.  Still, I wouldn't have wanted to take it without chasing it down with juice.  Would I try it again?  Sure.  Though that could change if I start retching like a sick dog in an hour.

The funny irony came in walking away from the shop.  Here I was, a shot of wheatgrass in hand, and my coworker with his cigarette.  The picture of health, eh?

I of course maintained the recommended first-shot-of-wheatgrass-caution.  Always try it the first time near a secluded trash can.  Fortunately our parking structure has a few.
