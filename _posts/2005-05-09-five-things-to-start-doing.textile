What are five things I can start doing to improve my fight against procrastination?

<ol>
<li>Expense my broadband access and cell phone service charges to work.</li>
<li>Shop for groceries more consistently.</li>
<li>View or return my NetFlix rentals more quickly.</li>
<li>Spend less time browsing the internet without a goal in mind.</li>
<li>Discover and implement one project each for putting the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/">iWork</a> applications to use.  I think I already have some ideas in mind (thanks to Crista on this).</li>
</ol>
