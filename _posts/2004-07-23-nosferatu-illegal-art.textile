Did you know, the first vampire movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013442/">Nosferatu</a>, was almost lost forever due to copyright enforcement?  The filmmaker lost a decision in favor of the estate of Bram Stoker, and all known copies of the film were transferred to Florence Stoker in 1925.   They were destroyed.

After Florence's death, new copies started popping up.  A classic example of something nearly lost to overzealous enforcement.

BTW, if you thinking draconian laws and requirements regarding archiving are a thing of the past, go read up on the <a href="http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org/archives/000148.html">broadcast flag</a>.
