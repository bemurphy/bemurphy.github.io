I've got more free time on my hands as of late, so I wanted to fill it with some exercise that would be fun and help pass the time.

After almost a 10 year hiatus, I am back training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  Don't know what it is?  Ever seen UFC?  Well, it's kinda like that.  Though, most days we aren't hitting each other.

It's so weird going back having been a blue belt before, and now feeling new to it again.  I can still remember some of the basics, but not much.  So sometimes it's a little awkward when the instructor announces for people to "go easy on Murphy, he's a blue belt returning after many years".  People are like...pfft...blue belt...why go easy!

It's also great to see my friend <a href="http://www.francobjj.com/">Franco</a> after all these years.  He's one of the most memorable, friendly, and interesting people I've met in my life.  There's few people I could be away from for 10 years, and go back to spending time with yet have it seem like no time has passed.  I'm glad to be back.

But oh man, does it hurt.
