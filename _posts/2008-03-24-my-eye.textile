So this is a bit of old news.  I was going back through the files on my camera I haven't pulled off in a few months, and found some pics of my eye when it got infected a couple months back.  I don't know why I'd think to share this, but oh well.  Anyway, it swelled way up, these don't even represent the worst of it.  I ended up having to see an opthamologist to have the infected tissue cut out.  He had to go in through the back of the eyelid.  It was far worse to anticipate than the surgery was itself.  So, if you ever wonder why I've got a little red spot on my right lower lid, it's the remnants of this.  It's still got a little ways to go before it totally clears up.
