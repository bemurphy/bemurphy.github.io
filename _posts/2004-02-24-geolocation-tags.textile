So I stumbled across two connected sites of interest last week.  <a href="http://www.geourl.org/">GeoURL</a> and <a href="http://www.localfeeds.com">localfeeds.com</a> seek to provide a <a href="http://www.geourl.org/add.html">simple mechanism</a> for throwing geographic coordinates onto a webpage.  A point of course being, to find owners or operators of sites within a certain area.  It's really a novelty at this stage, but someday it <a href="http://www.isedb.com/news/index.php?t=reviews&id=587">might pay off</a>.

You can click on the GeoURL button on the right hand side to find sites tied to people in my vicinity.  Of course, too bad for now it's flooded mostly by DeviantArt sites.
