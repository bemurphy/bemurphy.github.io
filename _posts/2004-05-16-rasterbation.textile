I ran across the <a href="http://homokaasu.org/rasterbator/">Rasterbator</a> a while ago.  Haven't put it to use yet, but I'm planning to get around to it soon.  See, the house I live in has it's original 70s styling mostly intact, inluding the 96xsomething inch mirror behind my bed.

Basically, the rasterbator takes any image, blows it up into a huge size of your choosing, and reprints it as a series of dots.  Pretty darn cool.  They've got a <a href="http://homokaasu.org/rasterbator/gallery.gas">gallery</a> of examples if you don't get it.
