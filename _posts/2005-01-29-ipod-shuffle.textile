<a href="http://www.biolachris.com" title="biolachris">Chris</a> informed me that the BestBuy near my house had a table full of iPod Shuffles for sale.  I was surprised, since no stores seem to have them in stock.  I picked one up.  Now I'll see if I can use it as motivation to exercise. 

I've used a flash mp3 player, some little sd player from rio.  However, here's the rub.  The rio music manager software just flat out sucks.  You couldn't even treat the device as a removable drive, which would have even been preferable to the software's non-windows like folder interface.  It was awful, putting music on it was a chore.

So, this is why Apple wins again.  Being able to toss the songs on from iTunes, where they all already nicely reside, is the biggest benefit.  Would I like a screen?  Probably, though, the only thing I ever used it for when running was to tell the time.  Since I carry my phone, that's a non-issue.

Anyway, it's pretty sweet.  And if you live in Orange County and want one, check out the BestBuy in Tustin Marketplace.
