For those of you attending game night on Sundays, I just wanted to say that our rounds of<a href="http://www.atomicsockmonkey.com/freebies.asp#mnpr"> Monkey Ninja Pirate Robot</a> for the past two weeks have been quite entertaining for me.  I hope you've enjoyed it as well.  For those that missed it, there's probably only two things to know.  First, <a href="http://darylsmith.blogspot.com/">Daryl</a> and I are in competition with each other in the game (or should I say, were, that's the second point).  Second, <a href="http://honkeydory4u.blogspot.com/">Ashley</a> swooped in last time, having never played, and won both rounds.

This Sunday, I eyeing either <a href="http://edge.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=2864">Marines vs. Zombies</a> or <a href="http://edge.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=4296&">Ship of the Line</a>.  Both are independent releases from <a href="http://www.fjgaming.com/">FJGaming</a>, which is basically one guy in England.  I've got MvZ assembled already, and Crista and I will likely assemble "Ship" this weekend.  I've already learned the rules for MvZ, and trust me, it isn't hard.   They fit on one sheet, in fact.  So don't let the "<a href="http://edge.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=2864">46 pages</a>" part throw you off.

Hope to see you there.  Or do I mean "here".  Well, you know what I mean.
