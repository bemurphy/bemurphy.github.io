Perhaps a sign of gaining acceptance of a blog app is when it starts getting comment spam.  I got my first today.  Yippie?  Fortunately, wordpress has a <a href="http://wiki.wordpress.org/How%20to%20combat%20comment%20spam%20with%20WordPress">feature</a> to throw a comment to moderation if it contains more than x number of links.

Now if the bozos give me any more trouble, I'm whitelisting via email address.
