       <p>My experience runs from unix & linux system administration, to programming for the web.  I'm a firm believer in open source, and spend much of my time these days in Ruby.</p>

    100 things
  </h1>
  <p>The NuclearMoose <a href="http://blog.nuclearmoose.com/archives/2004/06/23/100-things/#more-147">inspired</a> me to write a 100 items list about myself.  Some sure to be trivial, some not.  He was pressured by WordPress guru <a href="http://blog.carthik.net/index.php">Carthik</a>  to do so.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>So, without further ado, 100 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>My screenname/emailaddress/whatever is &#8216;xternal&#8217; and was derived back in the 80s while I was staring at an external modem.</li>
<li>My sophomore year of college, I died by brown hair black.  Thought it would wash out, it didn&#8217;t.</li>
<li>I am fairly shy.</li>
<li>At 5&#8217;8&quot; I may be (almost) short, but I&#8217;m the tallest in my immediate family.</li>

<li>I also can play clawhammer banjo.</li>
<li>I mispronounced &#8220;measure&#8221; until high school.</li>
<li>In academic studies, I prefered science &amp; technology, as well as music.  Chemistry was the bomb, literally.</li>

<li>As pets, I&#8217;ve had dogs, fish, mice, but never cats.</li>
<li>I have one sibling, a younger brother.</li>
<li>I prefer linux and bsd over Microsoft products</li>

<li>I hate 99% of TV sitcoms.</li>
<li>I am a Christian, but struggle with my faith.</li>
<li>I try not to drink too much soda, but am a coffee fiend.</li>

<li>I prefer the city to the country.</li>
<li>I have a back as well as shoulder injury.</li>
<li>I am not a vegetarian, but often eat like one.  Lots of soymilk and tofu.</li>
<li>My favorite quick meal is tofu stir fry with vegetables, noodles, and way too much kung pao sauce.</li>
<li>I like seafood, and will eat fish.</li>
<li>It takes me years to get over a girl.</li>
<li>I will listen to almost any kind of music that has prominent guitar work in it, as long as it&#8217;s not radio friendly country.</li>

<li>I am not a big Star Wars fan.</li>
<li>Short hair is sexy.</li>
<li>I go to the movies about three times a year.</li>
<li>One of my biggest social pet peeves is when groups of friends get together, only to argue about what to do.  Either do something, or don&#8217;t argue, just watch TV and shut up.</li>
<li>It greatly disturbs me when people rely on urban myths in trying to teach on some point.</li>
<li>When it comes to hanging out, I&#8217;d much rather go sit and do nothing but talk over coffee with a small group of friends, than go and try to find something entertaining.</li>

<li>My mother thinks I&#8217;m &#8220;too thin&#8221;, whereas I want to loose about 5 pounds (only if it&#8217;s fat, though).</li>
<li>During a childhood trip to Hawaii, I accidently dragged my fully clothed brother off a wall into the ocean with me.</li>
