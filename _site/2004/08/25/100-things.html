  <h1>100 more things</h1>

  <p>I decided it was time to make another 100 things list.  This one I&#8217;m sure will be much tougher, especially as I&#8217;ve been in a much more reflective mood lately.  Plus, I&#8217;m putting a little effort into avoiding collisions with the previous list.</p>
<p>So here goes.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m a very insecure person.</li>
<li>I like to think I&#8217;m sensitive, but in reality have a difficult time sharing my feelings.</li>
<li>I feel more attractive than the last time I made a list.</li>
<li>When I follow someone to work that&#8217;s in business clothes and on a cell phone, I always compare myself to the person and feel radically different than them.  I can&#8217;t see myself turning out that way.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m a child at heart.</li>
<li>I need to lighten up (funny in light of the previous item).</li>
<li>I often buy things to try and make myself happy.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s easy for me to get addicted to a sport or hobby.  Usually it lasts around 2 years.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve had one hangover in my life.  Don&#8217;t worry too much, it was well after I was 21.  My mom is going to kill me when she reads this, btw.  It was good in that it reminded me why I don&#8217;t drink, but still a mistake.</li>
<li>I prefer cute women to &#8220;Barbie doll&#8221; women.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve started watching too much television again.  I&#8217;d quit at least one week during &#8220;TV Turnoff Week&#8221;.</li>
<li>Sometimes immediately after I go home from hanging out with a big group of friends I get really lonely.</li>
<li>One of my goals for the next year is to learn to interact with groups better.</li>
<li>I voted for Bush but feel he let me down badly.</li>
<li>My least favorite of the more popular American sports is baseball.</li>
<li>Someday I&#8217;d like to play doubles badminton.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m capable of picking the average lock.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m fairly passive.  For example, if I was in a sandwhich shop and was given the wrong meal, I&#8217;d probably eat it and smile.</li>
<li>Currently I do almost all my grocery shopping at Vons.  I am a slave to convienience.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t balance my checkbook.  I&#8217;m a financial moron for the most part.  That doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m an easy con.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m scared and distrustful of dentists.</li>
<li>When I was in Jr. High, I wanted to pierce my nose and ear and string a chain in between.  Thanks go to a guitarist from Skid Row over that.</li>
<li>I wish I had listened more intently to Dr. Thurber and Dr. Woo when I attended <span class="caps">BIOLA</span>.  Especially Dr. Thurber.</li>
<li>One of my most cherished early childhood memories is when my dad took me with him to the school he worked at.  I think it was a Jr. High or High school.  He let me run the track with the students in PE, I beat them and got an honorary ribbon in the mail a few weeks later.</li>
<li>I used to enjoy fishing a lot, but now think I&#8217;d feel awkward having to bash a fish over the head.</li>
<li>I think my grandfather John is probably the smartest guy in my whole family.</li>
<li>Once in elementary school, I mistakening referred to my grandfather, who has a background in pharmaceuticals, as a &#8220;drug dealer&#8221;.</li>
<li>While watching the movie <em>Airplane</em> with my family, I embarassingly questioned outloud if the inflatible auto-pilot was what a &#8220;real autopilot looked like&#8221;.</li>
<li>I wish I took more digital photos.  Not so much good pictures, mind you, but good memories.</li>
<li>I have very few moments photographically archived.</li>
<li>Back in my submission grappling days (ya, I know) I had a lower body fat percentage but weighed 15 pounds more.</li>
<li>I have a bad habit of wearing the same pair of pants for too long in a given week.  Guess I should buy more pants.</li>
<li>I&#8217;d like to think I really do prefer substance over style.</li>
<li>When I spend time near a woman, I ask them &#8220;What are you thinking&#8221; as much as the stereotype of women (not men) suggests is typical.</li>
<li>In college, my roommate Kenny and I (sorry for the implication, bud) used to enjoy running around the college computer lab with earbud walki-talkies and being quite the hackers (or maybe I should say crackers).</li>
<li>At work, I use the console based email client called Mutt instead of one with a graphical user interface.  For the non-techies out there, that&#8217;s sort of like using the cmd prompt in windows instead of the file manager.</li>
<li>I have a serious contempt for shallow people, but sometimes fear I play the role quite well myself as a defense mechanism.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve driven three of my own cars so far.  First I had a red, used VW fox.  Then I leased a white honda civic, then I bought the green civic I drive now.</li>
<li>I usually think with a far more &#8220;know your enemy&#8221; mentality than the typical person.</li>
<li>Foriegn films are enjoyable.  Those of you who can&#8217;t deal with subtitles are missing out, in my opinion.</li>
<li>On one morning ride to school in 10th grade, my foot slipped off my bike pedal into the front tire.  I flipped head first, knocked out my two front teeth, and aced the side of my face.</li>
<li>I find I struggle to find the words when it matters most.</li>
<li>American flags in church make me feel uncomfortable.</li>
<li>The most unique place I&#8217;ve ever played guitar was on a rickety train in Morocco.  It was appreciated at first but then started irritating the older passengers on the train so I stopped.</li>
<li>I often wish I had greater confidence in discussing differing viewpoints of morality, ethics and faith.</li>
<li>I wish i knew how to work on cars as well as my dad.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m a total guy:  when I see something sweet in a movie that I internally appreciate, I often still externally mock it to assert my &#8220;manliness&#8221;.</li>
<li>Last time I wrote a 100 things list, I hadn&#8217;t been on a date for about 2.5 years.  Shorlty after I went on a blind date with somebody I&#8217;d met on the internet.  It was so not-like my personality, but I did it for practice.</li>
<li>I dislike when people act like their &#8220;professional&#8221; job makes them better than other people.   Yet, I&#8217;m sometimes guilty of it myself.</li>
<li>Today I paid $1 into a office lottery pool, if I remember correctly, for the first time in my life.</li>
<li>My room is usually cleaner now compared to when I last made a list.</li>
<li>Even though I sometimes crave attention, I really hate being at the center of it.</li>
<li>I maintain a highly defensive behavior pattern, but would like to work toward breaking the cycle of it.</li>
<li>I have never owned a Mac.  The closest I got was at <span class="caps">BIOLA</span> when Kenny&#8217;s sister let us borrow hers for a semester.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve skipped the weddings of many friends because I was bitter.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve recently been reminded of the value of old friends.  People I thought my closeness to was gone for ever are back like never before.</li>
<li>I can probably out talk many women.  Shocking!</li>
<li>I tease people too much.</li>
<li>Sometimes when I&#8217;m on an elevator, I wish I was more friendly and talkative.  Even if it&#8217;s just two floors.  Even if it&#8217;s just a genuine &#8220;Hello&#8221;.</li>
<li>Occassionally I have to mentally flog myself for wasting time sitting through a totally stupid film on Comedy Central or SciFi (oh my gosh, I watched <em>Corky Romano</em> this weekend!?!)</li>
<li>Outside of an office, I&#8217;ve always felt I relate better to younger people.  There&#8217;s probably good reason, I didn&#8217;t really hang out with people much until I graduate high school, and at that point most my friends I&#8217;d made from church were younger.</li>
<li>I love watching John Stewart on <em>The Daily Show</em></li>
<li>I used to be repulsed by the idea of watching <em>South Park</em> but recently saw quite a few episodes and thought it was really funny.  It was one of those things i felt guilty at laughing at, though.</li>
<li>I think Stephen Colbert of <em>The Daily Show</em> is one of the most underestimated funny men on the planet.  I&#8217;d watch an episode of <em>Strangers With Candy</em> just to see him string together his signature multiple double negatives (I don&#8217;t even know what to call that).</li>
<li>The more I type, the more troubled I become with my poor grammar.</li>
<li>My favorite teacher up through High School was my first semester Chemistry instructor, Scott Feir (not sure that&#8217;s spelled right).  He made me want to go to class more than any other teacher.</li>
<li>I love bad puns as jokes.</li>
<li>I am tickled by redundant phrases like &#8220;most favorite&#8221;.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve always wondered if you can&#8217;t feed Gremlins after midnight, when is it ok to start feeding them again?</li>
<li>One of my biggest pet peeves in hanging out with a large group of people is when you go to out to eat, and people feel compelled to push together the smaller tables to make a bigger table.  As if there&#8217;s some automatic assumption it&#8217;s acceptable to rearrange the facility without asking permission.</li>
<li>I hate playing first person shooting games without being able to use a mouse.</li>
<li>StarCraft is probably my favorite real time strategy game.  I loved Total Annihilation but all my friends hated it.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m proud of my brother&#8217;s artistic abilities.</li>
<li>Often if I make an extended point (more than 1 minute, even) in front of a group of people, the muscles in my jaw start to tighten due to anxiety.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t own enough new shoes.</li>
<li>I hate roller coasters.</li>
<li>I have never been on Space Mountain at Disneyland.</li>
<li>In parking lots, I almost exclusively park my turning one direction.  I think it&#8217;s left but can&#8217;t remember unless I&#8217;m in my car.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m not sure who my best friend is.</li>
<li>I prefer individual or smaller team sports to big team sports.</li>
<li>In Jr. High, my PE class loathed me because I loved to run the track.  Our coach, Mr. Robbins used to ask me if we should run the track or not, and I&#8217;d always say &#8220;Yes&#8221;.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t like poker.  And there is way too much of it on TV</li>
<li>I can&#8217;t resist playing a smartalek word joke with people when they over use the famous &#8220;f&#8221; word as an adjective.  &#8220;Dude, do you play that [sic] game?&#8230;No, but I play <em>that game</em>.&#8221;</li>
<li>The state I&#8217;ve spent the most time in, outside of California, is Colorado.</li>
<li>I utilize the comma too much when I write.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m exponentially more frightened to be vulnerable around more than one person than i am of a single person.  Not sure how unique that is.</li>
<li>Spiders scare me more than any other insect.</li>
<li>The most consistent &#8220;fear of school&#8221; dreams I had never involved embarassing public speaking.  They usually involved losing my class schedule and being totally clueless as to where to go.</li>
<li>In elementary school I actually played D&amp;D.</li>
<li>The element of the Old Testament I have the most difficulty with is the flood.</li>
<li>Often because I don&#8217;t feel vocal enough regarding my opinions, positions, and beliefs, I feel like a fraud.</li>
<li>Sometimes I think I overextend my welcome in IM conversations with people.</li>
<li>I can juggle, but really only three bags/balls at a time.  I never learned clubs well.</li>
<li>I greatly admire a man who strives to put family in front of his work.</li>
<li>The worst food poisoning I&#8217;ve ever had in my life was when I was travelling in Morocco.  I couldn&#8217;t even keep bottled water down.  My travelling friend Steve with me had the bug simultaneously.</li>
<li>The derrogatory title for women that starts with &#8216;b&#8217; is one of the words I hate the most.</li>
<li>After the big Northridge earthquakes, I called in sick to work.</li>
<li>I blush easy.</li>
<li>Sometimes I get embarassed to tell people what I&#8217;m eating, so I tell them I haven&#8217;t eaten yet (a lie!)</li>
<li>The first girl I ever had a crush on was named Dawn.  I even remember her last name but won&#8217;t put it here.  We played handball in elementary school together.</li>
