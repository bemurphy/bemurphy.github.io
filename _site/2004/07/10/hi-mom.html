  <h1>Hi Mom!</h1>

  <p>I&#8217;ve joined the ranks of people who&#8217;s moms have found their site.  Well, perhaps found isn&#8217;t the best term.  It was more like, I showed my site to my dad as an example of what I&#8217;d set up for him, and, you get the idea.</p>
<p>So not only was the site identified, but read in depth.  Every single comment even.  Obviously, this leads to some mild discomfort, but it&#8217;s far less traumatic than I&#8217;d expect.  Of course, any mention of the fairer sex was referred back to me multiple times, with questions like &#8220;so what are you going to do about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand, some aspects were quite cool.  For starters, hearing your mom say she likes your site is great!  It was a neat experience discussing the identities of some of the commenters.  &#8220;Which &#8221;http://biolachris.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Chris</a> is that?&quot;&#8230;I explained.  Then it got more interesting.  &#8220;Who&#8217;s &#8221;http://www.brendoman.com&quot;&gt;Brendoman</a>?&quot;  So I explained, he&#8217;s a guy that went to Biola that I never really met there, but ran across his site after we&#8217;d both left the school.  She asked me some questions about his plan to visit China.  &#8220;Who&#8217;s &#8221;http://danny.brendoman.com&quot;&gt;Danny</a>?&quot;  Danny is a friend of Brendoman, I ran across his site and found we had some similiar interests.  What was interesting about this was it was a chance to explain a newer social model to someone who was unfamiliar with it.  And beyond that, my posting was behaviour she found quite atypical for me, as I&#8217;m very private.  So while I&#8217;m doing something lots of other are engaged in, at the same time I was reminded it&#8217;s something unusual for me.</p>
<p>Now I just have to convince myself not to censor posts any more than previously.</p>
