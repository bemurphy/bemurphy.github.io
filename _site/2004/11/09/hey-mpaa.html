  <h1>Hey MPAA...</h1>

  <p>&#8230;you suck.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>This rant has been in me forever.  Others have already shared the sentiment.  But you know what the most offensive &#8220;<span class="caps">PSA</span>&#8221; style campaign in recent memory is?  Try the &#8220;don&#8217;t pirate&#8221; ads we get to enjoy before sucking down your $10 a head flicks.  Is this only me?  I doubt it.  I just <em>paid</em> to watch your movie, and you are exploiting my captivity to remind me to keep behaving like a good boy.  So here is some advice.  The last thing you should be doing is reminding your <em>paying</em> customers that they may be engaging in criminal activity elsewhere.  Well guess what, we <em>paid</em> for our tickets, so cut us some slack, mmm k?</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be fun for other media industries to follow suit?  We can then watch the hilarity ensue.  Have the newspapers get a crack at it first.  Here is my suggested warning:  &#8220;Attention subscribers, sharing this paper with your neighbor hurts paperboys&#8221;.  The warning should replace page one.  Also, it would be good for the newspaper to somehow be sealed shut to force the consumer to consume the message longer.</p>
<p>If you want to bombard the public with your heavy handed tactics (&#8220;oh look, the best grip is crying because he can&#8217;t buy a thanksgiving turkey!  I really should have paid for <em>The Fast and The Furious 16</em>&#8221;) then fork up the cash and pay from some more ads.  But how about you leave them out of the places you know people have paid.</p>
<p>Then again, I could be wrong.   Perhaps college students across America are walking away from your lessons filled with doubt and conviction.  Uh-oh, wakey-wakey time.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s a novel (not actually) thought.  Perhaps you should focus on developing incentives for people to buy your products.  Let&#8217;s see, get it for free or pay for it.  Why should we pay again?  Oh that&#8217;s it, because it&#8217;s the right thing to do and it supports the industry.  You know what, that&#8217;s fine with me.  But guess what, most people don&#8217;t care.  See your bed, Hollywood?  That&#8217;s right, you&#8217;ve helped create an amoral vacuum of relativism in American society, and now you want people to do the right thing.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s a suggestion.  Go out and do some research on the rate of &#8220;piracy&#8221; of the Criterion Collection discs versus say, the best of Bruckheimer/Bay.  I <em>bet</em> you&#8217;ll see a difference. Now why do you think that could be?  Could it be you shape your audience?  Could it be, people are less willing to buy cat food for dinner than say, a nice fresh albacore steak?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m out of sarcasm&#8230;</p>
