  <h1>
    NotNot Alternative
  </h1>

  <p>There&#8217;s a common ruby convention out there, I call it NotNot.  You&#8217;ll find it often in predicate methods, and it looks like it sounds, &#8216;!!&#8217;.  I suppose you could call it &#8220;Bang Bang&#8221;, or perhaps it has a real name I&#8217;m not aware of.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like NotNot, primarily I think because in my head it seems like the dreaded English grammar double negative.  In other words, it&#8217;s just weird.</p>
<p>The point of the NotNot is for your classes to return true/false, rather than just truthy/falsy.  Let&#8217;s start with a simple example predicate:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1109678.js?file=first_example.rb"></script><p>What?  That looks kind of strange, however, it will pass conditional tests, since ruby treats the values nil and false both as falsy values, while other values as truthy.  But again, the returns look weird.  Enter the NotNot:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1109678.js?file=second_example.rb"></script><p>Hey, those returns looks better, I see we&#8217;re getting back real true/false which is really what we want.  But that NotNot looks weird.  Think about it in your head, what&#8217;s the value of not not false&#8230;uh.</p>
<p>Say hello to the TrueClass#&amp; method.  The <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/TrueClass.html#M000564">TrueClass RDoc states</a> that the &amp; method &#8220;Returns false if obj is nil or false, true otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1109678.js?file=third_example.rb"></script><p>You&#8217;ll note we&#8217;re still getting back true/false.  The method is less terse than the NotNot, but I think slightly a better match intuitively.</p>
<p>In the end, it really boils down to style and readability.  If you code Ruby, while it&#8217;s important to know the NotNot, I&#8217;d advise something your brain doesn&#8217;t have to double unroll.</p>
<p>Hat tip to my friend <a href="http://www.billpratt.net/">Bill</a> for taking me straight from example 1 to 3 when I started in Ruby.</p>

  <h1>
    Onward to Jekyll
  </h1>

  <p>In the grand tradition of getting bored with blogging software, without actually taking the time to blog, I&#8217;ve transitioned software yet again.  This time I selected <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> to try.  I discovered that in the past I&#8217;ve had a habit of writing blog posts in TextMate or Vim, and then pasting them into whatever blog software I was using at the time.  That&#8217;s silly.  Now I can just edit in my editor of choice, have full <em>syntax aware</em> access to template and <span class="caps">CSS</span> documents without dealing with a nasty web interface, and have greater flexibility for throwing different pages up on the site.  With blog software, it&#8217;s often like pulling teeth when you want those pages that are more <span class="caps">CMS</span> than blog.  Not so with Jekyll.  It&#8217;s a template system that simply builds a static site out of layout and markup files (I&#8217;m using textile).  When you want that one-off page, all you have to do is drop it in.  There&#8217;s no requirement that it play nice with the rest of your site, it could truly be a one-off if you so desired.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want some fun and simple software to test-drive, I&#8217;d recommend it.  Not that it&#8217;ll get me to post any more.  Or perhaps, it will.</p>

  <h1>
    Metaprogramming in Ruby: Part 1
  </h1>

  <p>I joked with a co-worker the other day that, sometimes I think I&#8217;m better at Ruby metaprogramming that straight ahead programming.  This is a serious exaggeration, and I don&#8217;t count myself as an expert at either.  However, it dawned on me that, I have a few friends that aren&#8217;t as exposed to metaprogramming concepts in Ruby, so, what better topic to share about.  Hopefully in the process, you&#8217;ll learn something new, and, I&#8217;ll become better at explaining Ruby concepts and sharing code.</p>
<p>Before I dive in with some introductory examples, a quick definition of metaprogramming is in order.  To quote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, &#8220;Metaprogramming is the writing of computer programs that write or manipulate other programs (or themselves) as their data, or that do part of the work at compile time that would otherwise be done at runtime&#8221;.  If you use Rails (and, I know you do), metaprogramming enables things you already do on a daily basis, such as dynamic find_by methods in ActiveRecord, or plugins that dynamically get a class to include them (acts_as_list, acts_as_tree, etc).</p>
<p>In this writeup, I&#8217;ll start with two extremely basic metaprogramming concepts.  In fact, these might not even be considered true Ruby metaprogramming, but, I wanted to start with some simple ideas which you may not have been exposed to in Ruby 101.</p>
<p>The first concept to get down in Ruby is that, classes are objects like anything else.  In Ruby, this means you can open the class and modify it on the fly.  The practice is affectionately called monkey patching or duck punching.  Let&#8217;s look at a simple example:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/222706.js"></script><p>You can see above, we&#8217;ve created a Foo class with a public instance method, bar.  Calling foo.bar, we&#8217;ll get the output we expect, &#8220;bar!&#8221;.  Next, we reopen the Foo class, and add a new public instance method, foobar.  Had we tried to use Foo#foobar before this, we&#8217;d get a NoMethodError exception, as expected.  However, having reopened and modified the class, we can call our new method.</p>
<p>The other demonstration I&#8217;d like to show is one way you can define methods on the fly.  This example is abstract and doesn&#8217;t represent a recommended use, it&#8217;s simply to prove the point.</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/222724.js"></script><p>Running this simple example, the first call to foo_two.bar will output &#8220;bar&#8221;.  However, once we call foo.cap_bar, the public instance method bar is changed.  Running it a second time will output &#8220;<span class="caps">BAR</span>!!!&#8221;.  A more common, rubyish way of defining methods at run time in Ruby is the use of <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Module.html#M001654" title="define_method">define_method</a>, which I&#8217;ll cover in a future post.</p>
<p>An important concept to keep in mind here is that, you aren&#8217;t modifying behavior solely on the foo or foo_two instances.  Instead, you are changing the behavior of any open instance of the Foo or FooTwo classes.  So in our FooTwo example, if you were to create a foo_too instance, calling foo_too.bar would run through the dynamically created method as well and output &#8220;<span class="caps">BAR</span>!!!&#8221;.  In future postings, we&#8217;ll see a different approach of opening instances and defining methods specific to that instance.</p>
<p>Hopefully this has whet your appetite a little, and, in the future, we can run through some more exciting examples of the metaprogramming facilities Ruby has to offer.</p>
