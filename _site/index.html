    A note about "friendly" passwords
  </h1>

  <p>Often in a web application, the time will come where you opt to generate temporary passwords for users.  One common approach to this is to use a helper that combines a small about of random data (such as 4 random numbers) with a word randomly selected from a pared down dictionary list.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t do this.  There are at least two reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Using a word list radically reduces password entropy</li>
	<li>Eventually a password will unintentionally perplex, or worse, offend someone</li>
</ul>
<p>If the day comes and the system generates the password &#8220;cigar1984&#8221; for somebody trying to quit smoking, that could be awkward.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m no crypto expert, but I&#8217;m going to assume that the ruby <em class="code">SecureRandom</em> library will do a better job than me at outputting random strings.  So it&#8217;s of use here.  For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s2">&quot;securerandom&quot;</span>

<span class="c1"># outputs something like &quot;Ht25IeNqIBUp&quot;</span>
<span class="no">SecureRandom</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">urlsafe_base64</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">gsub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/[^a-z0-9]+/i</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="o">]</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>This strips non-alphanumeric characters such as &#8216;_&#8217; and &#8216;-&#8217; out.  This is useful because people are less used to typing them, and also, certain mouseclick-to-copy behaviors will split on those characters depending on the environment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that certain characters often will confuse users if they are manually entering a password as viewed in an email.  Fonts can make characters including the following difficult to distinguish</p>
<ul>
	<li>0 (zero)</li>
	<li>1 (the number one)</li>
	<li>I (the uppercase i)</li>
	<li>O (the uppercase OH)</li>
	<li>l (lowercase L)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <em class="code">String#tr</em> these out for substitutions, or strip them alltogether.  This will slightly reduce entropy, but by keeping a longer<br />
password you compensate somewhat.</p>

  <h1>
    An Example of Wrapping
  </h1>

  <p>You&#8217;ve been tasked with adding comments to some internal system at work.  You throw together some new controllers and views into your app, and churn out the feature quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>A few days pass, and a peer comes and informs you, &#8220;Hey, have you seen the comments?  Some people are swearing up a storm and Bob is <em>irritated</em>!&#8221;  You are left wondering, what to do.  You quickly discover there&#8217;s an <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/obscenity">Obscenity</a> gem for Ruby, and get cracking.  At stage one, you&#8217;re just going to output sanitized versions of comments, rather than resort to draconian measures.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume an overly simple, Comment model with one property, content, that looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="no">Comment</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Struct</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:content</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="c1">#...</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Dont&#8217; worry about database, etc, it&#8217;s beyond the point right now.  Dropping in a <em class="code">#clean_content</em> method is quick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="no">Comment</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Struct</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:content</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">clean_content</span>
    <span class="n">content</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="no">Obscenity</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sanitize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">content</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dup</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Now off to update the views and change the references to <em class="code">@comment.content</em> to <em class="code">@comment.clean_content</em> and you&#8217;re done.   Wait, not so fast, that&#8217;s only one option, with others to consider.  Possible options include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Changing the view references, as mentioned</li>
	<li>Using a helper method like <em class="code">sanitized_comment(@comment)</em> to return the clean content</li>
	<li>Opening your model back up and changing the content to return sanitized content, and storing the original content in <em class="code">#unsanitized_content</em></li>
	<li>Wrapping your @comment instance and taking advantage of Ruby duck typing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick example of accomplishing the last.  The presenter/exhibit/delegate pattern in Ruby are often presented as a way to decorate new methods onto an instance, such as taking an underlying object with an <em class="code">#amount_in_cents</em> attribute and adding a new method for outputing it as readable currency.  Another way to leverage this is to intercept calls to an <em>existing</em> method, like <em class="code">#content</em>, and change its behavior.  Let me show you what I mean.</p>
<p>First, <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/delegate/rdoc/SimpleDelegator.html">SimpleDelegator</a> can provide an easy wrapping for instances:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">CleanComment</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">SimpleDelegator</span>
  <span class="c1"># In case you want to get back at the original</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">unsanitized_content</span>
    <span class="n">__getobj__</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">content</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="c1"># Ensure clean content</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">content</span>
    <span class="n">clean_content</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>When you want to sanitize the comment, say after finding it via a controller, wrap it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="vi">@comment</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">CleanComment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">comment</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Now your views can keep rolling on with a calls to <em class="code">@comment.content</em> and be none the wiser.  Remember, Ruby&#8217;s duck typing is powerful;  rely on what instances respond to, as opposed to what they are instances of.</p>
<p>This is partially a matter of taste, remember there&#8217;s often not a &#8220;right way&#8221;.  What&#8217;s important is to have options, and leverage the option that feels right given the situation at hand.  Different approaches have different pros &amp; cons.  With wrapping, for instance, you have to remember to wrap!  And if it&#8217;s a collection, you must wrap them all.  There&#8217;s gems like <a href="https://github.com/drapergem/draper">draper</a> or <a href="https://github.com/objects-on-rails/display-case">display-case</a> that can help you on your way.</p>

  <h1>
    Two Support Objects You May Have Missed
  </h1>

  <p>If you spend time daily in a large ruby project (such as a Rails app) that has ActiveSupport pulled in, you are likely relying on its string, time, hash, and other extensions.  I&#8217;ve found two objects it provides prove useful, and having found them lesser known amongst my coding friends, figured they are worth sharing.</p>
<p>The first useful tidbit is the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/StringInquirer.html">ActiveSupport::StringInquirer</a> class.  It&#8217;s a <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/ef53d915164da7f757d03c4a70fe38e374c08b14/activesupport/lib/active_support/string_inquirer.rb#L13">simple method missing call</a> that lets you do prettier equality tests on strings.  If you&#8217;ve ever done a <em class="code">Rails.env.development?</em> check, it uses this implementation.  Let&#8217;s go to the code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="no">Rails</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">env</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">development?</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; true</span>
<span class="no">Rails</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">env</span>              <span class="c1"># =&gt; &quot;development&quot;</span>
<span class="no">Rails</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">env</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">class</span>        <span class="c1"># =&gt; ActiveSupport::StringInquirer</span>

<span class="n">si</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">ActiveSupport</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">StringInquirer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;foo&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">si</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">foo?</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; true</span>
<span class="n">si</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bar?</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; false</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>I think this is great for two reasons.  First, it&#8217;s a more expressive use of code, and secondly, it implies less coupling to a string outside of an object.  Let&#8217;s take a simple example: a role for a User object.  Imagine you start simple, where role is just a string.  Now let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re using <a href="https://github.com/ryanb/cancan">CanCan</a> to add simple authorization to our app, with an ability class that looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Ability</span>
  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">CanCan</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Ability</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="no">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">role</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;admin&quot;</span>
      <span class="n">can</span> <span class="ss">:manage</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:all</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>
      <span class="n">can</span> <span class="ss">:read</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:all</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Note we&#8217;re doing an <em class="code">#==</em> for comparison on that role.  This is a bit ugly and not as expressive as I&#8217;d like.  Let&#8217;s get rid of ugly with the help of the StringInquirer.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">role</span>
    <span class="n">role</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">read_attribute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:role</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_s</span>
    <span class="no">ActiveSupport</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">StringInquirer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">role</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Ability</span>
  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">CanCan</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Ability</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="no">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">role</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">admin?</span>
      <span class="n">can</span> <span class="ss">:manage</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:all</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>
      <span class="n">can</span> <span class="ss">:read</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:all</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="kp">private</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">role</span>
    <span class="vi">@user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">role</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>I&#8217;ve redefined <em class="code">User#role</em> to wrap the attribute in a StringInquirer, and updated the Ability class to call the role with the predicate <em class="code">#admin?</em> method. Our end behavior for ability checking is the same, but I think we&#8217;ve got more readable code.  There&#8217;s another win on this: we&#8217;ve decoupled from treating our role like a string which can pay out nicely in the future.  Imagine for instance the day arrives when a user no longer has one role, but many.  A simple user may be able to function as both a forum moderator or a comment moderator.  You can shift to supporting <a href="https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/wiki/Role-Based-Authorization">many roles per user</a> with a bitmask method and leave your external calls untouched.  A simple application of <em class="code">define_method</em> or <em class="code">method_missing</em> on your role attribute wrapper is all you need to keep rolling.  Now, you could also define <em class="code">#==</em> on your role object for such string comparisons, but comparing to a string reads more like the caller knows too much of an implementation detail.  I haven&#8217;t touched on the <em class="code">User#role=</em> setter here;  you may need some sanitizing and cleanup on it if you were assigning it the results from the getter method anywhere (and, ahem, possibly breaking encapsulation with your own string assignments, too).  I&#8217;ll leave that as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>Our second friend is the <a href="http://rails.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/SecureRandom.html">ActiveSupport::SecureRandom</a> interface.  Actually, saying this is from ActiveSupport is a little misleading.  If you are working on an older Rails 2 project, you&#8217;ll probably be using this by way of ActiveSupport.  However for modern and future use, this is deprecated and delegated to Ruby 1.9.x <a href="http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/securerandom/1.9.2/SecureRandom">stdlib&#8217;s SecureRandom</a>.  SecureRandom is great for generating random character strings on the fly that are useful as <span class="caps">API</span> keys, temporary passwords, tokens, etc.  It&#8217;s simple to use, and can replace those naive calls to <em class="code">rand()</em> you&#8217;ve been making for generating random strings.  Don&#8217;t reinvent the wheel!  I&#8217;ll leave you with a few examples:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="no">SecureRandom</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hex</span>    <span class="c1"># =&gt; ace59c788b498fadcaa88216e45cf800</span>
<span class="no">SecureRandom</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">base64</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; iJKR2NQ8Jk1wBdp0nU/fhA==</span>

<span class="c1"># Optionally pass 5 for 5 hex pairs</span>
<span class="no">SecureRandom</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hex</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; a5f8bf212f</span>

  <h1>
    Spec your codebase, not just your code
  </h1>

  <p>Many rubyists are familiar with using Test::Unit, RSpec, or MiniTest for specifying the behavior of their application code.  Over the past year, I&#8217;ve discovered a novel and less conventional use of testing tools I like to call &#8220;specifying the codebase&#8221;.  Let me show you what I mean.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever worked on a sizeable Rails project, you&#8217;ve probably experienced some codebase quirks at some point.  For example, I&#8217;ve got an application that had issues when the <a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid Templating engine</a> was loaded as a gem.  The fix was to include a specific version as a plugin.  While it&#8217;s usually best to get to the root of the problem, sometimes it&#8217;s not feasible or expedient and such measures must suffice.  Once Liquid was included as a gem, we noticed some failing tests, and then pieced together that, oops, Liquid had been reconfigured as a gem.  A code review may have caught this, or perhaps not, since it&#8217;s a little quirky.  Now the second time we made the mistake, it dawned on me, write a spec to send up a red flag and make it easier to spot the immediate problem when tests fail in the future:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">describe</span> <span class="s2">&quot;The codebase&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">&quot;doesn&#39;t load the liquid gem&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="no">Gem</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">loaded_specs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">any?</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">first</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;liquid&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">should</span> <span class="n">be_false</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to make the mistake of not properly compressing or optimizing assets, especially images, in your app&#8217;s public directory.  Code review or possibly even your vcs can help prevent such problems, but you can also let your specifications alert you to the problem:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/public directory includes files less than 1MB&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">files</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sb">`find </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="no">File</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span> <span class="no">Rails</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;public&quot;</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sb"> -type f -size +1M`</span>
  <span class="n">files</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\n/</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">should</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="o">[]</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>The pattern emerging here is pretty simple:  if you or your teammates make any repeat mistakes with your codebase, write a spec to prevent further repeats.  By all means, make sure to communicate and talk out application guidelines, yet, nothing says &#8220;hey, over here!&#8221; like a failing test.</p>
<p>The applications here are pretty endless.  Maybe you&#8217;ve got a Sinatra app on Heroku where you precompile dynamic stylesheets, and have made the mistake of checking in a busted css one too many times;  there&#8217;s a spec for that!  Or perhaps you&#8217;ve got an overzealous teammate adding or removing crazy things from git file index.  First, do better code review and, secondly, there&#8217;s a spec for that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">&quot;leaves config/database.yml out of the repository&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">git</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Git</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Rails</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">git</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ls_files</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;config/database.yml&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">should</span> <span class="n">be_empty</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Finally, there&#8217;s some important safety notes for techniques like this.  First, you may find yourself using system commands like find or grep.  If you&#8217;re confident you&#8217;ve got a fairly consistent environment your application is developed and run on (i.e. *nix boxes) this is probably OK.  However, don&#8217;t trickle this practice over towards reusable code, like gems you write and share with the world.  It&#8217;s not kind to Windows users out there.  Secondly, tests like this are often going to integrate with a real filesystem, so for goodness sake stick to read only operations.   Don&#8217;t touch, rm, cp, or mv files about.  If you find yourself wanting to perform destructive operation, the rakefiles are that-a-way.  And again, don&#8217;t share this behavior with your application or gem code, but rather, use gems like <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/fakefs">FakeFS</a> for testing in isolation of the filesystem.</p>

  <h1>
    NotNot Alternative
  </h1>

  <p>There&#8217;s a common ruby convention out there, I call it NotNot.  You&#8217;ll find it often in predicate methods, and it looks like it sounds, &#8216;!!&#8217;.  I suppose you could call it &#8220;Bang Bang&#8221;, or perhaps it has a real name I&#8217;m not aware of.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like NotNot, primarily I think because in my head it seems like the dreaded English grammar double negative.  In other words, it&#8217;s just weird.</p>
<p>The point of the NotNot is for your classes to return true/false, rather than just truthy/falsy.  Let&#8217;s start with a simple example predicate:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1109678.js?file=first_example.rb"></script><p>What?  That looks kind of strange, however, it will pass conditional tests, since ruby treats the values nil and false both as falsy values, while other values as truthy.  But again, the returns look weird.  Enter the NotNot:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1109678.js?file=second_example.rb"></script><p>Hey, those returns looks better, I see we&#8217;re getting back real true/false which is really what we want.  But that NotNot looks weird.  Think about it in your head, what&#8217;s the value of not not false&#8230;uh.</p>
<p>Say hello to the TrueClass#&amp; method.  The <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/TrueClass.html#M000564">TrueClass RDoc states</a> that the &amp; method &#8220;Returns false if obj is nil or false, true otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1109678.js?file=third_example.rb"></script><p>You&#8217;ll note we&#8217;re still getting back true/false.  The method is less terse than the NotNot, but I think slightly a better match intuitively.</p>
<p>In the end, it really boils down to style and readability.  If you code Ruby, while it&#8217;s important to know the NotNot, I&#8217;d advise something your brain doesn&#8217;t have to double unroll.</p>
<p>Hat tip to my friend <a href="http://www.billpratt.net/">Bill</a> for taking me straight from example 1 to 3 when I started in Ruby.</p>
