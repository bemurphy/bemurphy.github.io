  <h1>
    The Humor of Car Salesmen
  </h1>
  <p>I&#8217;ve been looking around at different dealerships to perhaps purchase a 2006 Mazda Miata.  Fortunately, as I don&#8217;t need a new car, the experience is less stressful than it could be if I was in need of wheels.  I have forgotten some of the depths to which the salesmen will go to try and pressure the consumer.</p>
<p>The most useless trick so far was for a salesperson to tell me, &#8220;look, I&#8217;m gonna tell you the truth about [so and so], so that you don&#8217;t have to look stupid in a dealership again&#8221;.  Hah, oh no, I look stupid!  Excuse me while I bow to your pressure and fold and buy right now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also appreciated repeated calls from my &#8220;friend&#8221; Ron at another dealership.  I think he&#8217;s left voicemail for me seven times since I visited the dealership.  Now, while Ron may be working to induce some kind of guilt in me to come back and buy on his terms, it&#8217;s having the opposite effect.  If the guy will call me that much, well, he must be desperate to sell.  So Ron, don&#8217;t tell me you can&#8217;t get the number.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also enjoyed witnessing the transition from &#8220;I&#8217;m not in love with these cars, I&#8217;ll make you a great deal, I want to sell&#8221; to the opposite &#8220;I don&#8217;t care who buys this car, I want my money for it&#8221;.  So, um, do you want to get the car off your lot today, or next week, or maybe never?</p>
<p>My personal favorite to date, however, was overemphasis on my last name.  It&#8217;s Irish, and, the salesperson started by asking about my &#8220;rich&#8221; family history, and telling me about his great trip to Ireland.  Then he launched into, &#8220;When I saw your lastname, I knew I had someone who knew his stuff&#8221;.  Butter me up, uh huh.</p>
<p>So here is my open notification to the car salesmen I may encounter (none of which will ever actually read it).  All I care about is the final price.  I don&#8217;t care if you think you know me, or want to brownnose me, or that you pretend to educate me.  In fact, I think the world would be a much happier place if you stopped doing this to everybody who steps in your door.  I exaggerate, but, still.</p>
<p>Oh, and boys, you&#8217;re getting the &#8216;07s on your lot.  That&#8217;s trouble&#8230;for you!</p>
