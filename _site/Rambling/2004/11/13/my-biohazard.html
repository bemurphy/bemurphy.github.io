       <p>My experience runs from unix & linux system administration, to programming for the web.  I'm passionate about open source, and spend much of my time these days in Ruby.</p>
       
       <p>My passions include git, github, rspec, rails, jQuery, programming in general, and my girlfriend Arielle.</p>
       
       <p>I like to hang out with other Ruby-ists in Orange County.  You can connect with us at the monthly <a href="http://www.ocruby.org">OC Ruby Users Group</a>.  We'd love to see you there.</p>

    My biohazard

  <p><img width="320" height="199" src="http://www.techfreak.net/images/tissues.jpg" alt="tissues" style="margin-bottom: 15px;margin-right: 15px; float: left"/>As previously noted, I got really sick.  My girlfriend unfortunately got sick too.  I don&#8217;t know who gave it to who, but that&#8217;s really of no consequence.  It made for a really rough week.</p>
<p>As you can surmise from my trashcan, my nose was going nuts the past couple days.  I probably should have cleared this all out earlier to avoid contamination.  It&#8217;s surprising I didn&#8217;t, because I have a newfound fear of our friend the germ.  I&#8217;ve been typing on a <a href="http://www.grandtec.com/vik.htm">Virtually Indestructible Keyboard</a> for the past couple days.  It&#8217;s not that nice to work on, but hey, I can throw it in the wash when I&#8217;m done and not worry about leftover germs.  I&#8217;ve been going nuts with Lysol sanitizing wipes, and, more importantly, Purell.  I must be using it like every five minutes.  But such things are in order when you suddenly find your eye glued shut from infection.  Ya, it was that fun.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my antibiotics have kicked in, my head is draining, and my eye is nearly healed.  For as intelligent as I can be about some things (oh, and modest too!) I can be a real idiot about health issues.  For instance, the notion of a copay seemed lost on me until I went to the doctor this past Thursday.  It cost me $10.  A whole $10!  Wow, now that&#8217;s why I pay health insurance monthly. When I left the office, I actually thought, &#8220;wow, I should do that more often&#8221;.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been to a doctor in 5 years, and probably haven&#8217;t taken antibiotics in more than 10 (not that there is a problem with the latter).  Which brings me to my final point, I think it&#8217;s about time I figure out if I&#8217;m really allergic to penicillin.  Last time I took it was my Senior year of high school.  The same weekend, I developed swelling on 70% of my body and had to take steroids to reduce the reaction.  We had assumed it was the medication, but it wasn&#8217;t conclusive.  I also got really sick last time I took erythromycin.  As a result I get stuck with limited choices for antibiotics and they cost about 4 times as much.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m done rambling and feeling sorry for myself.  Actually, I stopped feeling sorry for myself yesterday when I realized it was in excess.</p>
