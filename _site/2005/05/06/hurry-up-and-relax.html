  <h1>Hurry up and relax</h1>

  <p>Lately I&#8217;ve become quite aware of how intentionally restricted I allow my life to be.  I don&#8217;t go to new places as often as I&#8217;d like (though don&#8217;t consider this an open invite), and am too often worried or consumed with anxiety.  Like I&#8217;ve said before, it&#8217;s getting better.  This isn&#8217;t meant as a &#8220;woe is me&#8221; complaint, but rather, a launching point for interesting observation.  The short of it is, I can be quite uptight!  An uncomfortable spot for sure, but certainly not horrible or awful.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>For the past few months, I&#8217;ve had a strange reaction to washing my hands in warm water.  Not a bad reaction, mind you.  It&#8217;s been quite pleasurable.  Perhaps too much though.  There are times, especially on cold days, when washing my hands feels so good it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m on drugs.  No, I don&#8217;t do drugs, never have touched anything illegal even.  But the euphoric feeling seems way beyond what the relaxation of warm water normally would bring.  Quite often, I have a strong desire to just leap into a hot tub when I have such a full body experience.  Why just leave it to the hands?</p>
<p>This of course brings me back to the notion of being uptight.  Exactly how rigid might this indicate I am?  Probably, a lot.  Probably so much that I go so far as to push away things I like.  So when I stumble across a pleasure so simple as warm, relaxing water, it feels consuming.  It&#8217;s obvious to me as a result of this observation, I can pursue at least two goals.  First, I need to be more relaxed across the board.  I&#8217;ve felt a great success in this lately.  I no longer wake up and feel like I&#8217;ve been thinking for two hours.  I feel calmer throughout the day, and suffer from obsessive thought patterns far less than I used to.  I&#8217;d credit much of this success to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebt"><span class="caps">REBT</span></a>, as well as spending more time daily in purposeful relaxed states.  You&#8217;d be amazed the good a little searching of iTunes for relaxing music can do you.  Secondly, I need to more vigorously pursue things I like.  Sure, the warm water feels great, but, there&#8217;s more to life than that.  This is a goal worth pursuing!  <a href="http://www.techfreak.net/wp/index.php/archives/2005/04/27/240/">My earlier thoughts</a> regarding a hobby are a good start.  Beyond that, perhaps I should even consider making more observations on what I like and don&#8217;t like.  Sounds like fodder for a good list.  I&#8217;ll try to get back shortly with my brainstorm of some fun things to try.</p>
